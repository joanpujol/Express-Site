# Express Site

![alt text](https://gdurl.com/aBds)

This is a portfolio site to showcase some projects I've built from the Treehouse JavaScript Techdegree.

The site contains a modern landing page, an about page where I talk a little about myself and how to contact me, and a series of project pages to show off and detail the first five projects from the Treehouse Techdegree.

All the data (model) I use in this project is contained within a JSON file.

I've used Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

I've used Node.js and Express to:

- Import the required dependencies
- Link the JSON with the Pug templates
- Set up routes to handle requests
- Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
- Handle errors
- Set up a server to serve the project

The changes I've made to the design are the following:
- font-family for main content is now Roboto
- font-weight for main content is now 620
- Changed link colors
- Changed portfolio-me class background
- Added new css classes to style a new error template
- Other minor changes
